# Elastic Agent Standalone Mode Setup

This guide walks you through the steps to set up the **Elastic Agent** in **Standalone mode** to directly connect to **Elasticsearch**, without using **Fleet mode**.

## Prerequisites
- **Elasticsearch** instance running (either on Elastic Cloud or self-hosted).
- Access to **Kibana** and **Elastic Agent** on your virtual machine (VM).
- Admin access to the **Elastic Cloud** console or Elasticsearch instance.

## Step 1: Install the Elastic Agent on Your VM

### 1.1. Download the Elastic Agent
- Go to the [Elastic Downloads page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent).
- Download the version matching your system (Linux in this case).

### 1.2. Install the Elastic Agent
- **For Linux**, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i elastic-agent-8.15.3-linux-x86_64.deb  # Replace with the actual filename
   ```
- After installation, verify if the agent is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo elastic-agent version
   ```

## Step 2: Configure the Elastic Agent for Standalone Mode

### 2.1. Navigate to the Elastic Agent directory

```bash
cd /opt/Elastic/Agent
```
### 2.2. Configure the **elastic-agent.yml** file for Standalone mode
- In Standalone mode, the Elastic Agent connects directly to your Elasticsearch instance.

1. Open elastic-agent.yml for editing:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/elastic-agent/elastic-agent.yml
```
2. Ensure the outputs section points to your Elasticsearch server (replace with your actual URL and credentials):
```yaml
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts: ["https://<your_elasticsearch_url>:443"]
    username: "elastic"
    password: "<your_password>"
    preset: balanced
```
- If using Elastic Cloud, the hosts URL will look like:

```bash
https://<cloud_id>.us-east-1.aws.found.io:443
```

## Step 3: Start the Elastic Agent
### 3.1. Start the Elastic Agent in Standalone mode
```bash
sudo elastic-agent run
```

### 3.2. Verify if the Elastic Agent is running correctly
```bash
sudo elastic-agent status
```
Expected output:

```lua
┌─ elastic-agent
│  └─ status: (HEALTHY) Running
└─ fleet
   └─ status: (STOPPED) Not enrolled into Fleet
```
## Step 4: Confirm Data in Elasticsearch
### 4.1. Check Elasticsearch Indices
Once the agent is running, it should be sending logs and metrics to Elasticsearch.

To confirm that data is being ingested, go to Kibana > Dev Tools and run the following query:

```json
GET _cat/indices?v
```
Look for indices related to your Elastic Agent. In Standalone mode, you should see indices like:

```
metrics-*
logs-*
```
If you see indices like .ds-metrics-fleet_server, it means the agent is still operating in Fleet mode.

## Step 5: Troubleshooting if Fleet-related Indices Are Present
If you are seeing Fleet-related indices (e.g., .ds-metrics-fleet_server), it means your agent is still enrolled in Fleet. To fix this:

### Option 1: Unenroll the Agent via Kibana UI
1.Navigate to Kibana > Fleet.
2.Go to the Agents tab.
3.Find the agent, click on it, and look for the Unenroll button in the top-right corner.
4.Click Unenroll to remove it from Fleet and return to Standalone mode.
### Option 2: Unenroll via API
If the "Unenroll" button is not visible, you can unenroll the agent via the Fleet API:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://<your_kibana_url>/api/fleet/agents/<agent_id>/unenroll" -H "kbn-xsrf: true" -u "elastic:<your_password>"
```
Replace <agent_id> with the actual agent ID found in Fleet.

## Step 6: Verify Agent Status
Once unenrolled, confirm the agent status:

```bash
sudo elastic-agent status
```
It should now show "Not enrolled into Fleet" and will be in Standalone mode.

## Step 7: View Data in Kibana (Standalone Mode)
1.Log into Kibana.
2.Navigate to Observability.
3.You should see Metrics and Logs from your standalone agent.
- Click Metrics to view collected metrics.
- Click Logs to view the logs.
####Expected Output for Standalone mode:

You will see metrics- and logs- indices, without any references to Fleet-specific data like **.ds-metrics-fleet_server**.

## Step 8: (Optional) Monitor Agent Performance and Logs
To monitor agent performance, check the logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/elastic-agent/elastic-agent.log
```
Ensure that the agent is sending logs to Elasticsearch without issues.
