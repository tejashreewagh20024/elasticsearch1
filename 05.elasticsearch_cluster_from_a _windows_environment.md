# Elasticsearch Cluster from a Windows Environment

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Windows Environment**:
   - A Windows machine where Elasticsearch and CURL will be used.

2. **Elasticsearch Installed**:
   - Ensure Elasticsearch is installed and running on your system. If not, refer to the [Elasticsearch Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).

3. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**:
   - Elasticsearch requires Java. Install the correct version compatible with Elasticsearch if it's not already installed.

4. **Network Access**:
   - Verify that port `9200` is accessible for communication with the Elasticsearch instance.

5. **Administrative Privileges**:
   - You'll need admin rights to modify system environment variables and install CURL.

## Using CURL to Connect to Elasticsearch

### Step 1: Install CURL on Windows

1. **Download CURL**:
   - Visit [CURL for Windows](https://curl.se/windows/) to download the tool.

2. **Extract CURL**:
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, e.g., `C:\curl`.

3. **Add CURL to System Environment Variables**:
   - Perform the following steps:
     - Right-click on `This PC` > **Properties** > **Advanced System Settings**.
     - Click **Environment Variables**.
     - Under **System Variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit**.
     - Add the directory where `curl.exe` is located (e.g., `C:\curl`).

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open the Command Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     curl --version
     ```
   - You should see the version details if installed correctly.

### Step 2: Connect to Elasticsearch Using CURL

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Launch the command prompt on your Windows system.

2. **Run CURL Command**:
   - Execute the following command to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster:
     ```bash
     curl -u elastic:bR-IK9uYdOaKAnhg4+oI -X GET http://localhost:9200
     ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - If the connection is successful, you should see the cluster details:
     ```plaintext
     {
       "name" : "your-cluster-name",
       "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
       "cluster_uuid" : "some-uuid",
       "version" : {
         "number" : "7.x.x",
         "build_flavor" : "default",
         "build_type" : "tar",
         "build_hash" : "hash-value",
         "build_date" : "date-time",
         "build_snapshot" : false,
         "lucene_version" : "lucene-version",
         "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "version",
         "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "version"
       },
       "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
     }
     ```

## Notes

- Replace `elastic` and `bR-IK9uYdOaKAnhg4+oI` with your Elasticsearch username and password.
- Ensure Elasticsearch is running on `http://localhost:9200`. Adjust the URL if your cluster is hosted on a different address or port.
- Use administrative privileges if you encounter permission issues when modifying environment variables.
