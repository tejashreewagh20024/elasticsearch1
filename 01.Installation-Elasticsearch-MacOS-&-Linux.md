# Install Elasticsearch from the Archive on Linux or macOS

Elasticsearch is available as a `.tar.gz` archive for Linux and macOS.

---

## Download and Install Elasticsearch

Download the latest stable version of Elasticsearch from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and install it on your system.

### Install on Linux

```bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-8.16.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.16.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-8.16.1/
```

**Explanation:**
- The `shasum` command verifies the SHA checksum of the downloaded archive against the published checksum.
- Expected output:
  ```bash
  elasticsearch-8.16.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: OK
  ```
- The extracted directory (`elasticsearch-8.16.1/`) is referred to as `$ES_HOME`.

---

### Install on macOS

```bash
curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
curl https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 | shasum -a 512 -c -
tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.16.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-8.16.1/
```

**Explanation:**
- The `shasum` command verifies the SHA checksum of the downloaded archive against the published checksum.
- Expected output:
  ```bash
  elasticsearch-8.16.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz: OK
  ```
- The extracted directory (`elasticsearch-8.16.1/`) is referred to as `$ES_HOME`.

## Run Elasticsearch from the Command Line

Start Elasticsearch using:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch
```

**Security Features Enabled by Default:**
- Authentication and authorization are enabled.
- A password is generated for the built-in `elastic` superuser.
- TLS certificates are created for both transport and HTTP layers.
- An enrollment token for Kibana is generated (valid for 30 minutes).
- The `elastic` password and Kibana enrollment token are displayed in the terminal.

To store the password as an environment variable:

```bash
export ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

By default, Elasticsearch logs to both the console (`stdout`) and the `<cluster_name>.log` file within the `logs` directory. It runs in the foreground and logs significant events when necessary.

**Stopping Elasticsearch:** Press `Ctrl + C`.

---

## Verify Elasticsearch is Running

Test the Elasticsearch instance by sending an HTTPS request to port `9200` on `localhost`:

```bash
curl --cacert $ES_HOME/config/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD https://localhost:9200
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "name" : "Cp8oag6",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "AT69_T_DTp-1qgIJlatQqA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.16.1",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "f27399d",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_date" : "2016-03-30T09:51:41.449Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.12.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```
