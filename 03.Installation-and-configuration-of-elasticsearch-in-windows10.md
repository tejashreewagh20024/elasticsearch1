# Installation and Configuration of Elasticsearch on Windows 10

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure the following:

1. **Windows 10 Environment**:
   - Elasticsearch will be installed and configured on a Windows 10 machine.

2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**:
   - Elasticsearch requires Java. Ensure the correct version compatible with Elasticsearch is installed.

3. **Administrative Privileges**:
   - Admin rights are needed to install services, modify configuration files, and set system environment variables.

4. **Firewall Access**:
   - Verify that port `9200` is not blocked by Windows Firewall or other security tools.

5. **Memory Requirements**:
   - Ensure sufficient memory (minimum 2GB) is available, as Elasticsearch can be resource-intensive.

## Installation of Elasticsearch on Windows 10

### Step 1: Download Elasticsearch
1. Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Visit the [official Elasticsearch download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
3. Under the **Download** section, select **Windows** as your operating system.
4. Click on the download link for the `.zip` file (e.g., `elasticsearch-8.15.3.zip`).
5. Save the file to your default download location.

### Step 2: Extract the ZIP File
1. Navigate to the downloaded ZIP file using File Explorer.
2. Right-click on the file (e.g., `elasticsearch-8.15.3.zip`) and select **Extract All...**.
3. Copy the extracted folder (e.g., `elasticsearch-8.15.3`) to `C:\`.

## Step 3: Install Elasticsearch as a Windows Service

To make Elasticsearch start automatically with Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `bin` Folder**:
   - Open Command Prompt and navigate to the `bin` directory of Elasticsearch:
     ```bash
     cd C:\elasticsearch-8.15.3\bin
     ```

2. **Install Elasticsearch as a Service**:
   - Run the following command in Command Prompt:
     ```bash
     elasticsearch-service.bat install
     ```

3. **Start the Elasticsearch Service**:
   - Start the service with this command:
     ```bash
     elasticsearch-service.bat start
     ```

4. **Set or Reset the Password**:
   - Open Command Prompt in the `bin` directory again:
     ```bash
     cd C:\elasticsearch-8.10.2\bin
     ```
   - Run the following command to reset the password for the `elastic` user:
     ```bash
     elasticsearch-reset-password.bat -i -u elastic
     ```
     - `-i`: Interactive mode  
     - `-u`: User

   - Follow the prompts:
     - When asked, type `y` to confirm resetting the password.
     - Enter the new password and re-enter it for confirmation.

5. **Check if Elasticsearch is Running**:
   - Open a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and navigate to:
     ```plaintext
     http://localhost:9200/
     ```
   - Enter the `elastic` username and the password you set earlier.

   - If successful, you will see a JSON response like this:
     ```json
     {
       "name" : "your-node-name",
       "cluster_name" : "your-cluster-name",
       "cluster_uuid" : "uuid",
       "version" : {
         "number" : "8.x.x",
         "build_flavor" : "default",
         ...
       },
       "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
     }
     ```

6. **Verify Elasticsearch is Running as a Service**:
   - Open the **Run** dialog (`Win + R`), type `services.msc`, and press **Enter**.
   - In the Services window, look for the service named **Elasticsearch 8.15.3**.
   - Confirm that the service status is listed as **Running**.

7. **Set Elasticsearch to Start Automatically (Optional)**:
   - In the Services window, double-click on the **Elasticsearch 8.15.3** service.
   - In the **Properties** dialog:
     - Set **Startup type** to **Automatic**.
     - Click **OK** to save the changes.

## Troubleshooting: Failed to Connect to Elasticsearch on Port 9200

### Error
If you encounter the following error while trying to connect to Elasticsearch:
```plaintext
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 9200 after 2229 ms: Could not connect to server
```
## Steps to Resolve: Check Firewall Settings

If Elasticsearch is not accessible on port `9200`, ensure that Windows Firewall is not blocking the connection. Follow these steps to allow traffic on port `9200`:

1. Open **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **Windows Defender Firewall**.
2. Click on **Advanced settings** in the left pane.
3. In the left pane, click on **Inbound Rules**.
4. In the right pane, click on **New Rule**.
5. Select **Port** and click **Next**.
6. Choose **TCP** and specify port `9200`.
7. Select **Allow the connection**, click **Next**, and apply the rule to the necessary profiles (Domain, Private, Public).
8. Name the rule (e.g., `Elasticsearch Port 9200`) and finish the wizard.

After completing these steps, verify if Elasticsearch is accessible on port `9200`.

# Configuration of Elasticsearch on Windows 10

1. **Open `elasticsearch.yml` file to configure:**
   - Navigate to `C:\elasticsearch-8.15.3\config`
   - Open `elasticsearch.yml` using an editor like VSCode or Notepad for configuration.

2. **Changes:**
   - To store data in C drive, update the `path.data` configuration as follows:
   ```yaml
   path.data: "C:\\elasticsearch-8.15.3\\data"
   ```
   - Save the `elasticsearch.yml` file after making this change.
     
3. **Restart Elasticsearch:**
   - Press Win + R, type `services.msc`, and press Enter to open the services window.
   - Locate `Elasticsearch 8.15.3` in the services list.
   - Right-click on it and select Start.

4. **Optional - To give multiple options to store data:**
   - If you want to store data on a different drive (e.g., D drive), you can configure Elasticsearch to use both C and D 
     drives by setting the `path.data` option like so:
     ```yaml
     path.data: ["C:\\elasticsearch-8.15.3\\data", "D:\\elastic_data"]
     ```
5. **Set the memory limit for Elasticsearch:**
   - By default, only 1 GB of memory is allotted to the Elasticsearch Windows service, which can cause errors when handling 
     multiple or large queries.
   - To increase the memory limit, follow these steps:
      1. Open a command prompt in the Elasticsearch folder.
      2. Run the following command:
      ```bash
      .\bin\elasticsearch-service.bat manager
      ```
   - This will open the configuration window.
      3. Go to the Java tab in the configuration window.
      4. Set the Initial Memory Pool and Maximum Memory Pool to higher values. For example, set both to 10 GB (10240 MB):
      ```painltext
      Initial Memory Pool: 10240 MB
      Maximum Memory Pool: 10240 MB
      ```
6. **Restart Elasticsearch Service:**
    - After updating the memory settings, restart the Elasticsearch service for the changes to take effect.
