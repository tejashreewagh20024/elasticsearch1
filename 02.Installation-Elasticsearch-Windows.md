# Install Elasticsearch with .zip on Windows

Elasticsearch can be installed on Windows using the Windows .zip archive. This comes with a elasticsearch-service.bat command which will setup Elasticsearch to run as a service.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the [`Download Elasticsearch`](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) page.

## Download and install the .zip package

Download the .zip archive for Elasticsearch 8.16.1 from: https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.16.1-windows-x86_64.zip

Unzip it with your favorite unzip tool. This will create a folder called elasticsearch-8.16.1, which we will refer to as %ES_HOME%. In a terminal window, cd to the %ES_HOME% directory, for instance:

```bash
cd C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-8.16.1
```

## Run Elasticsearch from the command line

Run the following command to start Elasticsearch from the command line:

```bash
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
```

When starting Elasticsearch for the first time, security features are enabled and configured by default. The following security configuration occurs automatically:

- Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for the elastic built-in superuser.
- Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer, and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.
- An enrollment token is generated for Kibana, which is valid for 30 minutes.
The password for the elastic user and the enrollment token for Kibana are output to your terminal.

We recommend storing the elastic password as an environment variable in your shell. Example:

```bash
$ELASTIC_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

By default Elasticsearch prints its logs to the console (STDOUT) and to the <cluster
name>.log file within the logs directory. Elasticsearch logs some information while it is starting, but after it has finished initializing it will continue to run in the foreground and wonâ€™t log anything further until something happens that is worth recording. While Elasticsearch is running you can interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port 9200 by default.

To stop Elasticsearch, press Ctrl-C.

## Check that Elasticsearch is running

You can test that your Elasticsearch node is running by sending an HTTPS request to port 9200 on localhost:

```bash
curl --cacert %ES_HOME%\config\certs\http_ca.crt -u elastic:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD https://localhost:9200 
```

The call returns a response like this:

```bash
{
  "name" : "Cp8oag6",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "AT69_T_DTp-1qgIJlatQqA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.16.1",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "f27399d",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_date" : "2016-03-30T09:51:41.449Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.12.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```
