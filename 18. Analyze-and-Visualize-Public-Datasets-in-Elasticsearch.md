# Analyze and Visualize Public Datasets in Elasticsearch
### Step 1: Import a Public Dataset into Elasticsearch
1.Elastic Cloud provides an easy way to upload and index public datasets using the ElasticSearch's ingest tools and the Kibana UI. Here’s how to do it:

Choose a Dataset:

- Select a public dataset from a source like UCI Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
- For example, use the "Air Quality Data" (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)from UCI to analyze pollution data over time.

2.Format the Dataset:
- Download the dataset (typically in CSV format).
- You can upload this directly into Elasticsearch using the File Data Visualizer in Kibana.

3.Use Kibana’s File Data Visualizer:
- Go to Kibana > Machine Learning > Data Visualizer.

Select File Data Visualizer.

Upload your CSV file (e.g., Air Quality data).

Kibana will automatically detect the schema and map the fields for you, including handling data types like dates and numbers.

4.Index the Data:

- After uploading the file, Kibana will give you the option to index the data into Elasticsearch.
- Click "Create index pattern" to define how the dataset should be stored.
- Kibana will create an Elasticsearch index for the dataset (e.g., air_quality_data).
- give index name (e.g., air_quality_data)
- click import

### Step 2: Explore the Data
1. Explore the Dataset in Kibana:

Go to Kibana > Discover.

<img width="327" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464908cd-136e-4660-b1d5-28b31c47c87c" />

Select the index pattern for your dataset (e.g., air_quality_data).

You can filter, query, and explore the data directly using the Kibana Discover tool.

2.Run Queries and Aggregations:

Use Elasticsearch Query DSL in the Dev Tools section of Kibana to run complex queries.

Example to aggregate the average pollution levels by city:
`json`
GET /air_quality_data/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "avg_pollution": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "NO2"
      }
    }
  }
}

### Step 3: Build a Dashboard
Create a Dashboard:
- Go to Kibana > Dashboards.

<img width="183" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433d9deb-fa98-4583-870e-97ef8112f87a" />

- Click Create a Dashboard and start creating visualizations.

<img width="772" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a33d85d-c9ff-4013-9530-91a50efbdb4c" />

Combine different visualizations to get insights, such as:
- A time series line chart showing pollution trends over time.
- A pie chart for city-wise distribution.
- A heatmap for pollution levels across various regions.
- Customize the Dashboard:
- Organize and resize the visualizations as needed.
- Save the dashboard (e.g., Air Quality Dashboard).

# Outcome
By the end of this implementation, you will have:

- Explored a public dataset (such as air quality data) using Kibana's Discover tool.
- Indexed and visualized the data directly in Elastic Cloud.
- Created useful visualizations to explore trends, distributions, and aggregates.
- Built a real-time dashboard to monitor pollution levels.
