# Practical Implementation Guide for Aggregations in Elasticsearch

This guide covers **bucket** and **metric aggregations** in Elasticsearch, and how to combine them for advanced analysis.

---

## Step 1: Set up your Elasticsearch cluster
Ensure you have an Elasticsearch instance running on Elastic Cloud

Elasticsearch should be running at `http://localhost:9200`. You will find a json. code
**use Kibana's Dev Tools to index data.**

## Step 2: Index some sample data
Before performing aggregations, we need to create an index and insert sample documents. 

### 1. Create an index (optional):
**Devtools**
```bash
PUT /sales
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "date": { "type": "date" },
      "amount": { "type": "float" },
      "category": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```
---

### 2. Index some documents:
Use the following example to index documents into the sales index:

**Devtools**
```bash
POST /sales/_doc/1
{
  "date": "2024-11-01",
  "amount": 120.5,
  "category": "electronics"
}

POST /sales/_doc/2
{
  "date": "2024-11-02",
  "amount": 230.7,
  "category": "clothing"
}

POST /sales/_doc/3
{
  "date": "2024-11-03",
  "amount": 75.3,
  "category": "electronics"
}

POST /sales/_doc/4
{
  "date": "2024-11-04",
  "amount": 150.8,
  "category": "clothing"
}
```
This creates a set of sample sales data with date, amount, and category.

---

## Step 3: Perform Bucket Aggregations
Bucket aggregations group documents into buckets based on field values. Examples include **terms**, **range**, and **date_histogram**.

### 1. Terms Aggregation (Group by category)
This aggregation groups documents based on the category field.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "categories": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "category"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Explanation:**

- **terms** aggregation groups documents by the **category** field.
- **size: 0** ensures no documents are returned, only the aggregation results.

**Expected Result:** This will return the buckets for each category with the count of documents in each category.

## 2. Range Aggregation (Group by **amount** range)
This aggregation groups documents into ranges of **amount**.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "amount_ranges": {
      "range": {
        "field": "amount",
        "ranges": [
          { "to": 100 },
          { "from": 100, "to": 200 },
          { "from": 200 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Explanation:**

- **range** aggregation divides documents into specified ranges (**to**, **from**, **to**).
- We have defined three ranges based on the **amount** field.
**Expected Result**: This will show the count of sales in each range (e.g., **0-100**, **100-200**, and **200+**).

### 3. Date Histogram Aggregation (Group by date in intervals)
The **date_histogram** aggregation groups documents based on date intervals.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "sales_by_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "date",
        "calendar_interval": "day"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation:

- **date_histogram** aggregates documents by the **date** field, using daily intervals.
- **calendar_interval: "day"** groups documents by each day.
**Expected Result**: This will return the count of documents per day.
---

## Step 4: Perform Metric Aggregations
Metric aggregations calculate numeric values, such as averages, sums, and min/max values.

### 1. Average Aggregation (Average amount)
Calculate the average of the **amount** field.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "average_amount": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation:

- avg calculates the average value of the amount field.
**Expected Result**: This will return the average amount of all sales.

### 2. Sum Aggregation (Total amount)
Calculate the total of the **amount** field.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "total_amount": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **sum** calculates the total sum of the **amount** field.
**Expected Result**: This will return the total sum of all sales amounts.

### 3. Min and Max Aggregation (Find the lowest and highest amount)
Find the minimum and maximum values of the **amount** field.

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "min_amount": {
      "min": {
        "field": "amount"
      }
    },
    "max_amount": {
      "max": {
        "field": "amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation:

- **min** and **max** calculate the lowest and highest values for the **amount** field.
**Expected Result**: This will return the minimum and maximum sales amounts.

---

## Step 5: Combine Bucket and Metric Aggregations
You can combine both types of aggregations to perform more advanced analysis. For example, you might want to find the total sales (**sum**) for each **category** (**terms aggregation**).

```bash
POST /sales/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "categories": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "category"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "total_sales": {
          "sum": {
            "field": "amount"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Explanation:

- The **terms** aggregation groups documents by **category**.
Inside each category bucket, the **sum** aggregation calculates the total **amount**.
**Expected Result**: This will return the total sales amount for each category.

---

## Step 6: Review and Analyze Results
Once you run the queries, the results will include aggregations like:

```json
"aggregations": {
  "categories": {
    "buckets": [
      {
        "key": "electronics",
        "doc_count": 2,
        "total_sales": {
          "value": 195.8
        }
      },
      {
        "key": "clothing",
        "doc_count": 2,
        "total_sales": {
          "value": 381.5
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
The output will show the number of documents (e.g., **doc_count**) and the calculated values (e.g., **total_sales**).

### Conclusion
In this guide, you've learned how to:

Perform **bucket aggregations** (terms, range, date_histogram).
Perform **metric aggregations** (avg, sum, min, max).
Combine bucket and metric aggregations for advanced analysis.
