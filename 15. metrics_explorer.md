# Objective 
### You will learn how to:
1. Monitor system performance (e.g., CPU and memory usage) for your infrastructure.
2. Visualize these metrics in graphs.
3. Gain insights into how resources like CPU and memory are being used in your environment.
4. Save and organize these visualizations for regular monitoring or sharing with a team.

This is especially useful if you manage cloud-based applications, as it helps detect issues like high resource usage or potential system bottlenecks.

# 1. Set Up Metrics Explorer
1. Log in to your Elastic Cloud deployment.
2. Navigate to:
   - **Observability** > **Infrastructure** > **Metrics Explorer**.

---

# 2. Add Metrics to Visualize
Metrics are the data points you want to analyze. Let’s focus on two common system metrics:
1. **CPU Usage** (`system.cpu.total.pct`):
   - This shows the percentage of CPU used across your system.
2. **Memory Usage** (`system.memory.used.pct`):
   - This shows how much memory is currently in use.

**Steps:**
1. In Metrics Explorer, click **Add a Metric**.
2. Search for and select `system.cpu.total.pct`.

# 3. Group Metrics by Hosts or Containers
Grouping helps break down the metrics per system component. For example, you can monitor CPU usage per server or per Docker container.

**Steps:**
1. Find the dropdown for **Graph Per** (it may show "Everything" by default).
2. Change it to **`kibana.version`** if you want to see version.
3. Alternatively, if you're using Docker or Kubernetes, choose **`docker.container.id`** or **`kubernetes.pod.name`** to monitor specific containers or pods.

---

# 4. Set a Time Range
By default, Metrics Explorer shows data for the last 1 hour. You can expand this to see data over a longer period.

**Steps:**
1. In the top-right corner, change the time range to **Last 24 hours** or **Last 7 days**.
2. Click **Refresh** to update the graph.

---

# 5. Visualize and Interpret the Graph
Now you should see a graph :
- for **CPU Usage**.

Here’s what to look for:
- If CPU usage (e.g., `system.cpu.total.pct`) is consistently above 80%, it might indicate a performance bottleneck.
- If memory usage (e.g., `system.memory.used.pct`) is consistently above 90%, it might indicate a need for more RAM.

---

# 6. Save the Visualization
1. go to Action > Open in Visualize

2. Once satisfied with the visualization, click **Save** at the top.

3. Name it something like CPU Usage Monitoring. then select New then click Save and go to Dashboard
